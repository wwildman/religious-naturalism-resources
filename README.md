# Religious Naturalism Resources

The _Religious Naturalism Resources_ site contains reviews of resources helpful to students of religious naturalism, as well as links to valuable sites pertaining to religious naturalism and interpretative essays on the theme of religious naturalism. The material is produced mainly by students of Boston University's [Religious Naturalism seminars](http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/relnat/index.htm). Please do not reproduce any of the information on this site without properly acknowledging the source, which means citing both the website (http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/relnat) and the original author(s) and editor(s), listed with each entry.

The editor's site (**Wesley Wildman's** [WeirdWildWeb](http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/index.htm)) includes many other resources for the study of theology and religion, and rewards exploration.
